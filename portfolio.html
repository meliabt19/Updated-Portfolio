Once the data was inputed it and submitted you would recieve places based off your input that would allow you access to photos people have taken of the place. The News retriever worked off of keywords, which works best with current news articles. Once the keyword was inputed and submitted you would recieve local, state, national, and international news pertaining to your search criteria. This was my first group project as well as the first time I have ever created a more complex website that showed me the improtance of time managament and communication among your developer group.</p>

                                    <p><span class="image right"><img src="Screenshot (7).png" alt="Day Planner" /></span>Day Planner: The Day Planner is an agenda application that allows a user to add daily events to their calendar and in real time tell when they would need to be at their next event. The application uses Eastern Standard Time as the time basis and as it goes through a normal workday (9am-5pm) it blocks the boxes out with colors. Green for boxes with events that are still yet to come, red for events that are in the current hour, and gray for all the unattended boxes with no event for the day. </p>

                                    <p><span class="image left"><img src="Screenshot (5).png" alt="Original portfolio" /></span>Original Portfolio: My original portfolio was assigned in the first 3 weeks of class. While not impressive to the ideal developer, at my current learning curve it demonstrates the knowledge ive gained over the course of the bootcamp. The original portfolio was to focus on making a responsive webpage and used no more than HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to create. My current portfolio is way more advance and compliments a more polished UI. As I continue in my studies the site will only become more advanced, but knowing how far I go is one of teh best reasons to be a coder. </p>
